\section{Conclusion}
As analytics frameworks increasingly support Machine Learning, methodologies for optimizing across the entire pipeline from data cleaning to model training are required.
In this paper, we propose \sysfull, a framework that integrates existing data cleaning solutions with Machine Learning model training.
\sys information from the model to inform data cleaning on samples, and uses the information from clean samples to update the statistical model.
Our experimental results are really promising as they suggest that these optimization can significantly reduce data cleaning costs.
Techniques such as Active Learning and SampleClean are not optimized for this setting, and we are able to achieve sharper cost-accuracy tradeoffs than either technique.
 
There are several exciting, new avenues for future work.
First, the data cleaning models that we explore in this work can be extended to handle non-uniform costs, where different errors have a different cleaning cost.
Next, the empirical success of Deep Learning has led to increasing industry and research adoption of non-convex losses in many tasks that were traditionally served by convex models.
We hope to explore how we can integrate with such frameworks and what we can analyze about the performance.
We will also explore what we can do if the analytics at the end of the pipeline is a black box function.
Techniques proposed in Reinforcement Learning likely apply as we simultaneously have to learn the properties of the function as we are cleaning.
