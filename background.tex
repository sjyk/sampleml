\section{Background}
\subsection{Machine Learning and Loss Minimization}
In parametric Machine Learning, the goal is to learn a set of model \emph{parameters} $\theta$ from training examples.
A common theoretical framework in Machine Learning is empirical risk minimization.
We start with a set of training examples $\{(x_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}$
on which we minimze an loss function $\phi$ at each point parametrized that is parametrized by $\theta$.
\[
 \theta^{*}=\arg\min_{\theta}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\phi(x_{i},y_{i},\theta)
\]
For example, in a linear regression $\phi$ is:
\[
\phi(x_{i,}y_{i},\theta) = \|\theta^Tx_{i} - y_i \|_2^2
\]
$\phi$ is often designed to be \emph{convex}, essential meaning bowl-shaped, to make the training this model 
tractable.
This class of problems includes all generalized linear models and support vector machines.

Typically, a \emph{regularization} term $r(\theta)$ is added to this problem.
The regularization term $r(\theta)$ is traditionally what is used to increase the robustness of the model.
$r(\theta)$ penalizes high or low values of feature weights in $\theta$ to avoid overfitting to noise in the
training examples.
\[
 \theta^{*}=\arg\min_{\theta}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\phi(x_{i},y_{i},\theta) + r(\theta)
\]
For example, a popular variant of linear regression is called LASSO which is:
\[
 \theta^{*}=\arg\min_{\theta}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\|\theta^Tx_{i} - y_i \|_2^2 + \lambda \cdot \|\theta\|_1
\]
By applying the L1 regularization term, if one of the features is particularly noisy, and does not add predictive value, it will get excluded.

Along these lines, other robust techniques have also been proposed.
For example, in the case of linear regression, we can change the $L_2$ norm to an $L_1$ norm to mitigate the effect of outliers:
\[
\phi(x_{i,}y_{i},\theta) = \|\theta^Tx_{i} - y_i \|_1
\]
The quadratic L2 loss implies that examples that deviate far from the typical example are quadratically penalized as opposed to linearly penalized with the L1 loss.
There is a natural tradeoff between robustness and efficiency.
The more robust a technique is, the less efficient it will be (i.e. estimate variance for a fixed number of training examples).

\subsection{Training on Clean Data}
How exactly does a data cleaning approach differ from a robust method?
We often in the problem setting where our data is systematically biased.
Consider an image classification task with incorrect labeling.
If we train a model with respect to the incorrect labels, while we might have achieve a good out-of-sample accuracy on the incorrect labels, the classifications are incorrect in a semantic sense.
Likewise, consider the case where we are predicting future product demand based on corrupted historical data.
Training a model with respect to the corrupted data might have a low $R^2$ cross-validation error, but is incorrect
at predicting the future trends.
In such scenarios, we see data cleaning as complementary to robust statistics.
Data cleaning gives us information about the ``true" data distribution, which is highly beneficial when errors have systematic biases.
Without cleaning, certain subpopulations of data might be frequently mispredicted. 

\subsection{SampleClean Project}
In our previous work, we studied the relationship between approximate query processing, data cleaning, and sampling \cite{wang1999sample, technicalReport}.
Traditionally, data cleaning has explored expensive, up-front cleaning of entire datasets for increased query accuracy.
We proposed the SampleClean problem, in which an analyst cleans a small sample of data, and then estimates the result to an aggregate query e.g., \sumfunc, \countfunc, or \avgfunc.
The main insight from the SampleClean project is that highly accurate answers for aggregate queries does not require cleaning the full dataset.
Generalizing this insight, there is a deep relationship between the application (i.e., the query) and how an analyst should budget their effort in data cleaning.
In fact, \avgfunc and \sumfunc queries are a special case of the convex loss minimization discussed in the previous section:
\[
\phi(x_{i,}y_{i},\theta) = (x_{i} - \theta)^2
\]

We then extended the SampleClean work to study cleaning Materialized Views \cite{technicalReport}.
Suppose base data is updated with insertions, deletions, or updates, we explored how we could efficiently propagate
changes to a sample of the view instead of the full view.
Subsequent queries on the view could be answered approximate.

We see this line of work as an extension and generalization of the work that we did in the past.
There are several new contributions in this work.
First, Machine Learning models give us a richer geometric information (e.g., gradients), which we can use 
prioritizing sampling.
In this work, we explore non-uniform sampling as opposed to the uniform sampling methodologies studied before.
Next, machine learning models are trained iteratively making them more amenable to adaptive processing where cleaned data can be fed back to inform the next set of samples.
Finally, in this work, we give a deeper treatment to the problem of sparsity where only small clustered subsets of data are corrupted.
We address this by using intelligent partitioning that segregates clean and dirty data.

\subsection{Stochastic Gradient Descent}
Sampling is naturally a part of any Machine Learning workflow 

Our goal is to design an anytime framework for training models on dirty data.
Our main idea is to introduce data cleaning into the iterative algorithms that train the models. 
The problems described in the previous subsections are often trained using a technique called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or one of its variants.
The basic idea of SGD is to draw a data point at random, calculate the gradient at that point, and then update a current best estimate with that gradient.
\[
\theta^{(t+1)}\leftarrow\theta^{(t)}-\gamma\nabla\phi(x_{i},y_{i},\theta^{(t)})
\]
 SGD can also be applied in a ``mini-batch" mode, where we draw a subset of data at random and update with the average gradient.
 \[
 \theta^{(t+1)}\leftarrow\theta^{(t)}-\gamma\sum_{i\in S^{(t)}}\nabla\phi(x_{i},y_{i},\theta^{(t)})
 \]
 At a high-level, this problem mirrors the problem explored in this work. We start with an initialization (the dirty model) $\theta^{(0)}$ and iteratively update the existing best model as we get more clean data. 
SGD and its variants are well-studied and there are lower-bounds on the convergence rates using these techniques. 

Recently, a number of works have explored non-uniform sampling distributions for stochastic optimization \cite{zhao2014stochastic, qu2014randomized}.
The main insight is that non-uniform distributions may on average estimate the gradient accurately.
The technique that is applied is called importance sampling.
Importance sampling preserves the exepected value of a parameter while trying to sample from a distribution that results in lower variance.
